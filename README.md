JS Library Project

The Library Project was a phenomenal way for me to dive into the use of object constructors and implement various isolated pieces of the Odin curriculum thus far into a simple project. I spent plenty of time researching new methods, new approaches, and various ways of creating functions/accessing needed data in order to solve problems as they arose. I feel as though I've become more comfortable planning a project prior to initiating the code, and understanding what might need to be done at each step in order to build out the desired project.
